		<p class="scroll">Writer, director, and star Angelina Jolie Pitt’s drama By the Sea will make its world premiere Nov. 5 as the opening film of AFI Fest, organizers have announced.

Reuniting Jolie Pitt and husband Brad Pitt on screen for the first time in a decade, By the Sea follows an American writer and his wife as they arrive in a picturesque seaside resort in 1970s France with their marriage on the rocks. Jolie Pitt has said the film, her directorial follow-up to Unbroken, is inspired by European cinema and theater of the ’60s and ’70s.

AFI chief Bob Gazzale said in a statement, “Time and again, Angelina Jolie Pitt has proven herself an artist of the highest caliber. It is an honor for AFI to celebrate her latest story with its world premiere — and in doing so — to shine a proper light upon her boundless creative energies as actor, director, writer, and producer.”</p>
